This toolbox contains programs for BP-MLL [1] algorithm. First use "BPMLL_train" function to train a multi-lable neural network, and then pass it to "BPMLL_test" function to perform testing. 

Please type "help BPMLL_train" and "help BPMLL_test" to get information about the usage of these two functions. Any problem, please feel free to contact me via zhangml@lamda.nju.edu.cn.
